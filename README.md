# Object Detection App Using YOLOv5 and Gradio

This project demonstrates a simple object detection application using the YOLOv5 model for identifying objects in uploaded images. The app uses Gradio to provide an easy-to-use web interface where users can upload an image and receive an output with detected objects, bounding boxes, and confidence scores.

## Features
- **YOLOv5 Model**: Pretrained on the COCO dataset to detect and classify 80 object classes.
- **Gradio Interface**: Simple web interface for uploading images and visualizing results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) installed with CUDA if available (optional but recommended for GPU support)
